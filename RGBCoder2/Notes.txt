Thank you for using the RGBCoder2 program!

- Tutorials/Examples can be found in the example folders.
- Must have PIL, tkinter, and the python string library set up to run the python3 version directly.
- If using Windows or Linux, I've compiled the program for you already in the "Prebuilt Executables" folder. (It's the same code, just compiled using PyInstaller)
- Program was developed on Linux, and as such looks the prettiest on that OS.

Have Fun!
